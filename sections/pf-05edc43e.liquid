These can include separation anxiety, thunderstorm anxiety, or anxiety bound up with overpowering fears (phobias). Prozac can help relax these anxieties and fears by increasing the amount of serotonin the brain uses.

Usually, it’s tied to a specific trigger or situation, like loud sounds, new environments, separation from their owner, car rides, going to the vet's office or groomer’s, etc. Most dogs will have some anxiety over some of these events, but very anxious dogs may have overpowering anxiety that leads to unwanted behaviors like damaging property, barking loudly, or resisting necessary treatment or grooming. <br><br>That said, dogs can suffer from age-related anxiety related to the loss of cognitive function. Dogs lose memory, awareness, and perceptive ability as they age, just like humans. They aren’t able to learn and adapt to new situation as quickly, and this can lead to anxiety and quarrelsome behavior.
<br><br>Prozac can help with age-related anxiety in dogs by helping them feel calmer and more relaxed.

When the owner leaves, the dog barks, destroys furniture, urinates and poops where they shouldn't, and otherwise acts out in ways they wouldn't if someone was home. This is unavoidable for some dog owners who have to leave a dog alone in an apartment or house while they go about daily activities.

This unwanted urination can be because of sexual drive, lack of exercise, lack of bladder control, general age-related anxiety, or other factors (or many factors at once!).

For example, many owners can mistakenly encourage anxious behavior by telling their pet “good boy” or “it’s okay” when they’re showing anxiety or a phobia about going to the vet or loud noises. <br><br>This encouraging behavior may even cause the dog to feel anxious or afraid when they hear that phrase. Talk to a veterinarian about how you can behave around, treat, and train your dog to be less anxious. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exercise:</span>	Both humans and dogs can feel anxiety, worry, and stress when they do not get enough exercise. This author cares for an Australian Shepherd that is an absolute terror indoors, showing signs of aggression and phobia – unless he’s been able to run a few miles that day, in which case he lies down and snuggles with everyone. Some humans choose to life weights intensely primarily to help them sleep, one of the immediate effects of intense exercise.	If your dog is an active breed, getting them enough exercise can be tough. Herding dogs and dogs bred for running may need to run for half an hour or more to meet their exercise needs, and without this, they will continue to display undesirable behavior. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct Underlying Causes:</span>	Underlying issues can cause some aggressions and anxieties, such as age-related cognitive decline. Drugs like selegiline can help correct cognitive decline and, in so, help reduce the anxiety or aggression it causes. A qualified veterinarian can only make these diagnoses – but if you have noticed that your pet's anxiety or aggression started as they aged and worsened with age, it's a great idea to bring this up with your veterinarian.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Medications:</span>	There are other SSRIs like Prozac that are used in dogs, including Celexa or citalopram, Paxil or paroxetine, and Zoloft or sertraline. They have many of the same pros and cons as Prozac, but some individual dogs may respond better to one or another or be less likely to experience negative side effects. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CBD:</span> 	Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been reported individually by many owners (including some vets!) to help with anxiety, aggression, and other issues Prozac also treats. Unlike Prozac, it has not been reported to have as many or as severe side effects at the usual dosing – especially when using a high-quality, lab-verified extract that does not contain THC. <br><br>THC can be toxic to dogs even at low doses. CBD is a good option to discuss with your veterinarian in looking at options, especially if Prozac or other prescription medications cause intolerable side effects or are too expensive. </span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-4dc3" data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-igXgud lhtyiH pf-245_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-cjrPHo eOcrMz"><div class="sc-clIzBv iQyrr pf-244_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-gXRojI kCnmwO pf-243_"><p class="sc-ehIJor eZpnKY pf-235_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-234_"><span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">Prozac Made My Dog Worse: Bella's Story</span></span></p><div data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-iWBNLc NncQz pf-236_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0079/3287/0756/t/6/assets/prozacmademydogworse-1658800868976.jpg?v=1658800871" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0079/3287/0756/t/6/assets/prozacmademydogworse-1658800868976.jpg?v=1658800871 1536w" width="905" height="408"/></div><p class="sc-ehIJor eZpnKY pf-239_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-238_">Bella was suffering.<br><br>Bella had anxiety, leash reactivity, a tendency to nervously pee everywhere, and a kind owner, Genevieve, who was worried sick about her.<br><br>Genevieve told me all about Bella when she came into my store, looking for solutions because Prozac wasn't working; it seemed to be making her worse.<br><br>Bella is only one of the ten's of dogs I've heard about personally who had a rough time on Prozac, and when you research Prozac and its effects on both dogs and humans, it's easy to see why.</span></p><a href="/blogs/tips/prozac-made-my-dog-worse" target="_self" data-pf-type="Button" class="sc-djWRfJ dtXvbo pf-242_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-241_"><font color="#ffffff">Read Her Story</font><br></span></a></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-f9a0" data-pf-type="GlobalSection" id="458855a7-715a-44af-a3d1-9c246cf519d3" class="sc-eQxpLG kGvvRo pf-169_">{% capture content %}{% include 'pf-458855a7' %}{% endcapture %}
