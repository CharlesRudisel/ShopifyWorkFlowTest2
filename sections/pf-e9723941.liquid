It potentially helps with unwanted dog behaviors, such as anxiety, aggression, urine marking, compulsions, and fear of humans.
<br><br>Sounds great, right? But really, I'd say that Prozac is far from "<i>great.</i>"
<br><br>Because it's a selective serotonin inhibitor, Prozac takes weeks and sometimes months to work because it takes a while for the serotonin to build up in the brain. And in the meantime, before it starts working, Prozac (like other SSRIs) is known to have a severely unpleasant acclimation period, which is often not worth it because it doesn't always result in improved symptoms.
<br><br>Prozac only helps 6 out of 10 humans see even moderate improvement. (That means 40% of users risk negative side effects and see minimal or NO improvement.) After my research, I suspect the percentage of humans it gives "excellent" results to is even fewer, maybe 10%.
<br><br>There's been no comprehensive study to show the efficacy rate in dogs, but there's no reason Prozac, a drug developed originally for humans - taking only human biology into account - should have a higher efficacy rate in dogs than it does in humans.
<br><br>Actually, seeing as Prozac was developed for humans, it would only make sense for Prozac to be less effective for dogs.
<br><br>In fact, some theorize that antidepressants only work in some humans because they stop these patients from feeling 'bad' - but they don't necessarily replace depressed feelings with happiness, just with numbness. For some depressed people, numbness is preferable to feeling bad. For other depressed people, numbness is worse and can cause suicidal feelings.
<br><br>If dogs could speak, I cannot think of a scenario where numbness would be a preferable feeling for a dog.
<br><br>Genevieve put Bella on Prozac when her vet recommended it. <br><br>*SIDE NOTE: I'd like to note that I have the utmost respect for the veterinary community. Veterinarians have to memorize every pet species' ailments, as well as hundreds of specialized medications for each species (they have <b>much</b> more to remember and to keep up to date with than a human doctor), so it's no wonder Genevieve's vet wasn't aware that there is a much safer natural alternative out there.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-4e39" data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-igXgud lhtyiH pf-28_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-cjrPHo eOcrMz"><div class="sc-clIzBv iQyrr pf-29_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-gXRojI kCnmwO pf-30_"><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bSqaIl iXTDAP pf-31_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-33_">Prozac's Potential Side Effects</span></h2><p class="sc-ehIJor eZpnKY pf-34_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-36_">Before I tell you the rest of Bella's story, I want to explain the side effects of Prozac for dogs.

have only been reported for humans taking Prozac. Slightly fewer side effects have been reported in pets, and it's easy to see why: our pets cannot tell us when they feel negative side effects.
<br><br>And unfortunately, it's difficult to recognize when our furry family members have negative side effects. After all, if a Saint Bernard is suffering from dry mouth, you might just notice he's drooling less; on the surface, that could seem like a good thing because he can't tell you <span style="font-style: italic;">not only</span> is his mouth uncomfortably dry, but he's also got a massive migraine.
<br><br>Worse yet, you cannot explain to your dog that these are "just" negative side effects of Prozac and that these side effects are <span style="font-style: italic;">theoretically</span> for his own good.
<br><br>All your dog knows is that they are suffering, all the while not knowing why.
<br><br>
What's worse is to a dog, the one month acclimation period when getting on Prozac, the period which the FDA warns can increase suicide in humans, is more like <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline;">7 months</span> proportionally because they live such short lives in comparison to us.
<br><br>
It's worth noting that Prozac is not prescribed to human children under seven years old because the potential side effects (such as suicidal thoughts) are so severe that a child under that age would not be able to understand or handle them. Which begs the question: why would anyone think it's okay to give Prozac to a dog who has much less comprehension than a child? <br><br>

Genevieve's dog, Bella, who I mentioned at the beginning of this blog, actually got worse on Prozac, thanks to these negative side effects. Genevieve kept her on Prozac for three months while seeing no improvement.
<br><br>
Instead, her beloved Bella was acting like a different dog entirely - and not a better dog. Bella had no desire to go on walks, had lost interest in treats, and in playing. The weirdest thing was she'd stand in front of Genevieve, just staring with no response to anything Genevieve said or did.
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It doesn't feel like a stretch to say Prozac was making Bella catatonic.

It's unlikely you're researching it out of idle curiosity. I'd say that alone means you're an excellent dog owner, clearly trying your best. There's no way you want your dog to suffer.
<br><br>Before trying Prozac, you almost undoubtedly have tried other solutions, like giving your dog more exercise, alternative training methods, and taking them to the vet, but it wasn't enough. Prozac isn't the right answer for many (if not most) dogs, but if not Prozac, what can you do instead?
<br><br>This was a question Bella's owner, Genevieve, asked herself as she weaned Bella off Prozac. Prozac had not worked for Bella and had instead made her worse, but Bella still had behavioral problems that needed to be addressed.
<br><br>Even with all the time, effort, and money Genevieve put in when she got Bella prescribed Prozac, Genevieve still had the determination to find an alternative solution for Bella.
<br><br>Nothing would make her give up on Bella's happiness and wellbeing, for Bella herself, and for Genevieve's sanity (she was justifiably sick of cleaning up Bella's anxiety-induced destruction and urination!).
<br><br>Genevieve could not bear to consider the alternative, which is why she came into my store and asked one simple question:
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"How could CBD possibly work for Bella when veterinarian-prescribed antidepressants had not?"
</span><br><br>The answer is a simple one: <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CBD can work for anxious and depressed dogs where antidepressants don't because CBD targets an entirely different biological system than antidepressants/SSRIs.</span>
<br><br>While Prozac works by building up serotonin in the brain over time, CBD works by targeting a part of the nervous system indirectly. The science is complicated to explain, and if you're curious, you can read more about it <a href="/blogs/tips/cbd-for-dogs-anxiety" target="_self" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">here</a>. But the long and the short of it is that CBD can be somewhat thought of as a way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">bring back</span> a natural balance to the brain and nervous system instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">making changes</span>.
<br><br>(The balancing effect of CBD is what makes it seem like such a miracle cure-all to some people; having an out-of-balance nervous system causes untold physical and mental ailments because of a long chain of domino effects.)<br><br>Genevieve then wondered out loud, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Why, if CBD is so effective, did her veterinarian not prescribe it in the first place?"</span>
<br><br>The answer to that is complicated as well. CBD has been used to help animals for thousands of years, with the earliest known use being by the ancient Greeks and Romans for their horses. The political climate around the war on drugs, unfortunately, lumped CBD in with marijuana because it is derived from the same species of plant, even though it is impossible to get “high” off of CBD alone. This political climate stopped veterinarians from learning about CBD in school, and opened a gap that Big Pharma stepped in to fill by recommending patented drugs riddled with side effects.<br><br>After hearing that, Genevieve decided to give CBD a try for Bella. I advised Genevieve that because CBD helps balance the body, while you can see results sometimes right away, continued use is best to achieve and maintain full balance.
<br><br>The next time I saw Genevieve, she had Bella with her. The first time Genevieve came into my store, she left Bella at home because of Bella’s tendency to get yappy and unwieldy in public.
<br><br>When I met Bella, I saw no signs of the black-and-white terrier-collie mix being anything other than a sweet, calm, happy dog.
<br><br>"CBD saved Bella's life!" Genevieve happily told me. Genevieve let me know that the biggest change thanks to CBD happened with Bella around week 2 of consistent use when Bella stopped anxiously peeing around the house when left alone. And unlike with Prozac, Bella experienced 0 negative side effects.
<br><br>If your dog suffers from anything like Bella suffered from (anxiety, reactivity, etc.) I implore you to give it a try in order to bring back balance to your dog's mental state. Even if your dog doesn't suffer from these things, it might be worth it to give it a try simply because there are studies pointing to CBD having the potential to increase the lifespans of animals.
<br><br>If you do decide to try CBD for your dog, make sure you get one made with broad spectrum extract that has <a href="/pages/lab-results" target="_self" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">verified potency</a>. There are an unfortunate amount of ineffective CBD pet products on the market, so it is important to make sure the company you choose is ethical and verified as selling what they say they are.
<br><br>Here at Relievet, we publicly display lab results and use a broad spectrum extract because that is the type of CBD with the highest science-backed efficacy and little to no adverse side effects.
<br><br>We make everything with the highest-quality, science-backed ingredients and all of our products are rigorously tested. If you're curious about our different offerings for your pet, <a href="/collections/all" target="_self" style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold;">you can find all of our products here</a>. <br><br>Or, if you're simply curious to read another story about CBD changing a dog's life, you can click the link below to read my story about my dear dog, Biscuit.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-1bdd" data-pf-type="GlobalSection" id="79fb1dd3-2498-4700-b182-0714bf6c8850" class="sc-eQxpLG kGvvRo pf-146_">{% capture content %}{% include 'pf-79fb1dd3' %}{% endcapture %}
