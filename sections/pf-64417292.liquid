<br><br>Like Gravy, almost 20% of all dogs will suffer from calluses on their elbows at some point.
<br><br>While they are usually not painful or dangerous, they can be itchy and uncomfortable to some dogs, not to mention unattractive.
<br><br>In some cases, if elbow calluses are left untreated, they can crack and bleed, becoming sores that can get infected.</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bSqaIl iXTDAP pf-28_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-30_"><span style="color: rgb(41, 171, 226);">Dog elbow callus infection</span></span></h2><p class="sc-ehIJor eZpnKY pf-31_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-33_">A dog elbow callus infection is not likely, but it is possible. If the skin has become so dry and crusty that it starts to bleed, it can become a breeding ground for infection. <br><br>Often dogs will lick a wound, which can worsen their condition. If your dog's skin is bleeding or red and inflamed, it's best not to apply anything to it and take them to the vet.<br><br>Gravy's elbow wasn't infected, so I continued searching to find out why this happened and what I could do to treat it.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bSqaIl iXTDAP pf-34_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-36_"><a name="what-causes-it"></a>

Think of them as nature's elbow pads. <br><br>While they were on his elbows, it's also possible for them to appear on the hocks, hips, sternum, and legs.</span></p></div></div><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-bSqaIl iXTDAP pf-42_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-44_"><a name="are-some-breeds-more-likely-to-get-one"></a>

Encourage your pup to sleep on that cozy, soft bed you bought him by making it an attractive place to be. Give him lots of praise and rewards such as toys or treats while lying there. <br><br>If your dog likes to lay outside during hot weather, consider buying one of those elevated beds or cooling pads.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-itWPBs dKPonY pf-58_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-BHvUt fJlZte pf-60_"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Exercise – </span>This one might seem obvious, but it's often overlooked.

However, before even using it I realized if Gravy was to lick it off, which he more than likely would, it would cause stomach problems as its not at all natural.&nbsp;<br><br>I had some coconut oil at home and had read it was a great natural moisturizer. After applying it to Gravy's elbows, I quickly figured that this probably wouldn't work. <br><br>The coconut oil was too liquid and made a huge mess. It would not stay on long enough to be an effective moisturizer. 
It was back to the drawing board. <br><br>I searched online and was bombarded with ads for an elbow elbow butter for dogs. I decided to give it a shot.&nbsp;<br> 
<br>At first, it seemed to work; It was clearly moisturizing his skin. Unfortunately, I was disappointed after I used up the whole tube a month later. His elbows were still rough and crusty. 
At this point, I felt like i'd tried everything. <br><br>Not only had I taken away the access to the hard surfaces he was encountering, but I'd also spent money on products designed specifically for this. <br><br>I started researching to see if I could find a solution. I'd already helped my arthritic dog Biscuit with our CBD oil. Could this possibly work for Gravy's skin issues too?
<br><br>It turns out that, yes, CBD can interact with receptors in a dog's skin. Maybe I could make a more effective product for dog elbow calluses.
I wanted to use only human-grade organic ingredients and make sure they would be safe for dogs even if eaten. <br><br>After talking to several vets and chemists, many failed attempts, I had something.<br><br>I chose a specific blend of essential oils that, while completely safe for dogs, gravy wasn't interested in licking off. I also made it in tube form so that it could be applied to cracked elbows without creating a mess.<br><br>It was time for testing, human testing. Thankfully, no humans were harmed, so it was Gravy's turn.&nbsp;<br><br>I twisted up the tube and covered his callus in the balm, massaging it into the layers of the callus.&nbsp;<br><br>I continued to apply it three times a day for the next two weeks. <br><br>The <a href="/products/cbd-hot-spot-and-itchy-skin-soothing-balm-for-dogs" target="_self" style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(41, 171, 226);">CBD Soothing Balm</a> was the extra boost his skin needed to regain a healthy balance.&nbsp;<br><br>A few months later, I decided to share this product with other pet parents. <br><br>Since then, Gravy and I have helped thousands of dogs with dry and damaged skin. 
What's more, we guarantee the product so if you're not happy; you don't pay a cent.
