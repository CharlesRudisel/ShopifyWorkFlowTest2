Usually, the whites of their eyes will not be visible, also known as "whale eye." The pupils will be an average size, not too big and not too small.<br></span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-38_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-40_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ears Language</span> - As dog ears vary in shape, size, and position depending on the breed.

Some dogs do look as if they are smiling. All dogs will bark or growl for various reasons. It is one of the ways that they communicate with other dogs and with their human companions.

Generally, if their tail is in its usual position for the particular breed, then all is well.<br></span></li></ul><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-avest iZvAhG pf-47_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-49_"><a name="dog-behavior-changes-to-watch-for"></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 170, 255);">Dog behavior changes to watch for</span><br></span></h2><p class="sc-hYQoXb koTnzq pf-50_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-52_">Observe your dog's overall body and all its body parts for the most accurate understanding of your dog's emotional state, and what they're trying to tell you.
<br>
<br>Look out for behavior changes such as:</span></p><p class="sc-hYQoXb koTnzq pf-53_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-55_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Body Posture</span> - Fear can be shown by rocking backward as if trying to lean away from the scary thing that they have just seen.
<br>
<br>Dogs that are fearful or unsure sometimes stand very still, often with their tail raised, and stare at whatever is worrying them.<br>
<br>Your dog may lean forward, shifting his weight to his front paws when threatened as on the offensive to make himself ready to defend and spring ahead to make the first move. In this way, fearful behavior can look like or even become aggressive behavior. Consulting a dog behavior expert, especially a veterinarian certified by the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, is the best way to keep you, your dog, and other people safe. Find a certified vet in your area <a href="https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709" target="_blank" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">here</a>.</span></p><p class="sc-hYQoXb koTnzq pf-56_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-58_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eyes </span>- The pupils (black middle part) of your dog's eyes can dilate (enlarge), and look glassy when they are excited or afraid.<br><br>Fear can also cause their eyes to open wide so that you can see the white part all around the colored section. A dog that is turning its head and looking away from something (showing the white part of their eye) is asking to be left alone. Noticing this subtle sign can help prevent stress and even dangerous behavior like biting.
<br><br>Furrowed eyebrows can also be a signal that your dog is nervous.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ears</span> - Twitching ears can indicate that your dog is listening carefully and can hear something.<br><br>Some dogs get upset when they hear loud or unfamiliar noises, such as fireworks or thunderstorms. Fear can cause a dog to hold their ears back and to the side.<br><br>A dog that is on high alert and feels threatened may have their ears facing forward.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mouth</span> - Tight mouth, heavy pant, and drooling can all be signs of a fearful, nervous, tense, or upset dog.<br><br>A very raised lip, showing teeth and gums, tells us that your dog feels threatened. If your dog makes this expression, use caution! Even if your dog is normally a sweetheart, exposed teeth mean that he or she is scared, protective, or angry enough to bite. Avoid getting near your dog’s face and remove them from the situation as quickly as possible.
<br> 
<br>Whimpering sounds can mean your pet is frightened, stressed, or anxious.<br><br>Dogs also tend to lick their lips repeatedly when nervous or uncomfortable. Keep an eye out for this sign and take action or your dog may progress to more dangerous behaviors, like running away or biting.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Barking </span>– Barking can be your dog's way of showing excitement, wants to play, or needs exercise.<br><br>However, it can also be a danger warning that there is an intruder in their space or home.<br><br>Excessive barking is also known to cause <a style="text-decoration-line: underline;" href="https://www.relievet.com/blogs/tips/what-is-tracheitis-in-dogs-symptoms">tracheitis in dogs</a>.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Growling</span> – This can be an early warning that something's wrong, but it does not always mean that the dog is being aggressive and is going to attack.<br><br>Growling is your dog trying to tell you that something is upsetting him, and he's trying to give you a chance to help him out of the situation that is causing the fear or anxiety.<br><br>Growling can also be a way to show dominance over another dog. For example, when both dogs want the same bone and don't want to share.<br><br>It's important not to teach your dog not to growl, as you will be taking away that communication channel that warns of an emotional state.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tail Signs </span>- A slow, low wag could mean that a dog is feeling threatened.<br><br>Usually, a loose tail that is standing up straight is a sign that your dog is ready to go on the offensive.<br><br>An anxious or fearful dog can have their tail tucked in between and under their back legs showing submissive dog behavior.<br><br>Fast wagging tail tends to mean that your dog is happy and excited.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-avest iZvAhG pf-59_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-61_"><a name="why-you-should-respond-to-your-dogs-behavior"></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 170, 255);">Why you should respond to your dog's behavior</span><br></span></h2><p class="sc-hYQoXb koTnzq pf-62_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-64_">Whether it's good or bad, you should always respond to your dog's behavior, as it will benefit your dog in:<br></span></p><ul style="--text-indent:0;--line-spacing:10px" data-pf-type="List" class="sc-edERGn TYgaU pf-65_"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-66_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-68_">Helping them if they are ill, or in pain</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-69_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-71_">Restraining them if they are aggressive or overexcited</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-72_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-74_">Praising them when they are well behaved&nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-75_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-77_">Reassuring them when they are afraid</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-78_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-80_">Rewarding them when they are good</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-jlsrNB kxxXtk pf-81_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-83_">Reprimanding them if they are misbehaving</span></li></ul><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-avest iZvAhG pf-84_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-86_"><a name="Dog-behavior-tips-and-tricks"></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 170, 255);">Dog behavior tips and tricks</span><br></span></h2><p class="sc-hYQoXb koTnzq pf-87_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-hGnimi cpnKBf pf-89_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be Kind</span> – A little reassurance can often go a long way to addressing certain behaviors.

Take your dog in for a checkup with their veterinarian to rule out disease as a cause of behavior changes.
